<h2>CSC 480 Homework #2</h2>
<h3>10 points possible (plus 2 extra credit)</h3>

<p>Do
the following variation of problem 3.17 (3.11) from the book.  
Implement
<b>iterative lengthening search</b> as described, and apply to
the Romanian Route problem discussed in Chapter 3.  Compare
the algorithm's performance to uniform-cost search and comment on your
results.  <i>Hint: Remember to check out the online code repository from the
book.  I solved the problem by modifying one of the lisp functions and
creating another one which was 6 lines long (but it's tricky, so don't
put it off!).</i>

</p><p>Extra Credit (2 points): 3.17 a, b, or c

</p><p><b>What to hand in:</b>  Please submit your code, and a description
of any of the code from the online repository that you used.  Also
submit a text file which includes a sample run of your program.  A
sample output from my program on the Romanian Route problem can be
found <a href="http://reed.cs.depaul.edu/peterh/class/csc480/romanianroute.txt">here</a> <i>but please note that while
it displays the h-cost for each node, it uses only the g-costs to do
the search</i>.  The (lisp-based) description
of the romanian map can be found <a href="http://reed.cs.depaul.edu/peterh/class/csc480/romania.txt">here</a>.
